The U momentum gives a coherent output for the first time step N=3 (likely division by h or k still needs to be checked)

The pressure matrix is rank deficient. The pressure values seem to be ok (at least they generate gradients that behave as expected on boundary).

Checked the h, k and Re divisions in the star step
